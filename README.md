Hello! My name is Thomas Young, and welcome to the third iteration of my personal website. With each iteration, I strive to learn new frameworks, tools, and explore different styles. This time, I am diving into Next.js as a React framework and utilizing Three.js to showcase some of the 3D models I've created over the past few years.

As the site evolves, I plan to add more of my artwork, programming projects, and other interesting endeavors. You can view the full website at [thomastheyoung.com](www.thomastheyoung.com).
